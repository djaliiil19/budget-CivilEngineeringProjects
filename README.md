# Flutter app to estimate the price of Civil Engineering Projects

![](https://github.com/manoellribeiro/budget-CivilEngineeringProjects/blob/master/images/appReview.png)

## About this Project

This project was made to simplify and optimize the budgeting process in a Junior Company called _Engetec Engenharia Jr_

## Why?

I want to made an app to learn how to use Flutter better, so I thought that solving a real problem at the same time would be a good idea.
Before I made this app the budgeting process used to be made with an Excel sheet,
 that sheet was really good, but it wasn't so accessible to everyone in everyplace. Now with this app
 they can estimate the price of Projects anywhere and give a quicker answer to their clients.

## Some Observations about this App

* There's no Login/Register functionally because this app is used only by the Company Members.
* It's not in Play Store or App Store.

## Features

* Estimate the price of five Civil Engineering Projects with specific variables for each projects, as the Building Standard or how many Floor Plans.
* Estimate the price of only one project or how many you want to.
* See the prices of all projects together in partial review page that only you can see.
* Save the budget of one client when you want to, so I members with this application can see It.
